William was also asked about what makes him feel optimistic, his favourite part of last night&#x27;s show, why he started Earthshot and where it will be held next year. The Q&amp;A on the couple&#x27;s Instagram Stories will likely be viewed as an attempt to help the monarchy reconnect with younger people as it battles to gain their support. And it comes as William told the Earthshot+ event today that he hopes the Prize will lead to the next generation not having to deal with &#x27;climate anxiety&#x27; by 2030.

The speed camera device was positioned at a busy junction to catch out drivers breaking the 30mph limit on busy city roads. But among those caught were the council&#x27;s own staff, with 38 notices of intended prosecution issued to Cardiff council vehicles. The new move faced backlash from councilors who claimed that motorists were getting caught out due to a lack of signage in the first week. After a sign was put up fines reduced and councillor Sean Driscoll (inset) said: &#x27;This clearly shows that if the vast majority of drivers were alerted to the changes, less people would have been fined, including possibly some of our hard pressed staff.&#x27;&quot;,&quot;previewText&quot;:&quot;Over 30 council workers have been stung by a new speed camera that their own bosses put into place at Western Avenue junction in Cardiff.&quot;,&quot;channel&quot;:&quot;news&quot;,&quot;showAsLiveDate&quot;:null,&quot;imageLargeDouble&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/02/14/77322769-0-image-a-5_1698935040190.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageLargePreview&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/02/14/77322769-0-image-a-4_1698935039535.jpg&quot;,&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/02/14/77322769-0-image-a-4_1698935039535.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE_PREVIEW_LARGE&quot;},{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/02/14/77321739-0-image-m-11_1698935060045.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE_PREVIEW_THUMB&quot;},{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/02/14/77322769-0-image-a-5_1698935040190.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE LARGE DOUBLE&quot;}],&quot;fbShareCount&quot;:13,&quot;piShareCount&quot;:0,&quot;commentsCount&quot;:46},{&quot;mobileGalleryCount&quot;:4,&quot;headline&quot;:&quot;Families forced to store dirty nappies in freezers after council introduces &#x27;climate saving&#x27; changes to its bin collections and rubbish piles up on the streets&quot;,&quot;largeHeadline&quot;:&quot;Families forced to store dirty nappies in freezers after council introduces &#x27;climate saving&#x27; changes to its bin collections and rubbish piles up on the streets&quot;,&quot;videoCount&quot;:0,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;AU&quot;,&quot;articleURL&quot;:&quot;/news/article-12700113/Families-nappies-rubbish.html&quot;,&quot;modifiedDate&quot;:&quot;2023-11-02T05:03:31+0000&quot;,&quot;articleId&quot;:12700113,&quot;socialHeadline&quot;:&quot;Families forced to store dirty nappies in freezers due to major change&quot;,&quot;authors&quot;:[&quot;Pranav Harish For Daily Mail Australia&quot;],&quot;firstPubDate&quot;:&quot;2023-11-02T02:25:34+0000&quot;,&quot;shortURL&quot;:&quot;https://mol.im/a/12700113&quot;,&quot;pageTitle&quot;:&quot;Families forced to store dirty nappies in freezers after council introduces &#x27;climate saving&#x27; changes to its bin collections and rubbish piles up on the streets&quot;,&quot;sponsoredArticle&quot;:null,&quot;largePreviewText&quot;:&quot;Locals in Sydney&#x27;s inner west are fuming after major change to their rubbish collection has left bins overflowing (right) with waste.

There have been a lot of D-words thrown around to describe evolving US-China relations - decoupling, de-risking, diversifying, disentangling - but Newsom&#x27;s marital metaphor was a new one. Perhaps nuptials were on Newsom&#x27;s mind because Xi Jinping treated him to a week-long honeymoon, clearly attuned to Newsom&#x27;s presidential aspirations and eager for a relationship with a younger, more naïve administration. I have criticized President Biden&#x27;s diplomatic accommodation of Beijing, but Newsom&#x27;s egregious overseas display makes Biden&#x27;s foreign policy look like Bismark-level realpolitik. To believe that the Communist Party of China (CCP) could be a trusted partner on environmental issues, is, as Oscar Wilde said about second marriages, the triumph of hope over experience.&quot;,&quot;previewText&quot;:&quot;REP GALLAGHER: I have criticized President Biden&#x27;s diplomatic accommodation of Beijing, but Newsom&#x27;s egregious overseas display makes Biden&#x27;s foreign policy look like Bismark-level realpolitik.&quot;,&quot;channel&quot;:&quot;news&quot;,&quot;showAsLiveDate&quot;:null,&quot;imageLargeDouble&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/29/16/77099561-0-image-a-2_1698596885144.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageLargePreview&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/29/16/77099561-0-image-a-1_1698596883125.jpg&quot;,&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/29/16/77099561-0-image-a-2_1698596885144.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE LARGE DOUBLE&quot;},{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/29/18/77098059-0-image-a-6_1698604322699.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE_PREVIEW_THUMB&quot;},{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/29/16/77099561-0-image-a-1_1698596883125.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE_PREVIEW_LARGE&quot;}],&quot;fbShareCount&quot;:143,&quot;piShareCount&quot;:0,&quot;commentsCount&quot;:559},{&quot;mobileGalleryCount&quot;:7,&quot;headline&quot;:&quot;Posed pumpkin patch pictures are a celebrity must-have for Halloween, but experts claim celebrities like Kylie Jenner and Reese Witherspoon are encouraging food waste&quot;,&quot;largeHeadline&quot;:&quot;Posed pumpkin patch pictures are a celebrity must-have for Halloween, but experts claim celebrities like Kylie Jenner and Reese Witherspoon are encouraging food waste&quot;,&quot;videoCount&quot;:0,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;GB&quot;,&quot;articleURL&quot;:&quot;/femail/article-12675923/Posed-pumpkin-patch-pictures-celebrity-Halloween-experts-claim-celebrities-like-Kylie-Jenner-Reese-Witherspoon-encouraging-food-waste.html&quot;,&quot;modifiedDate&quot;:&quot;2023-10-29T13:29:21+0000&quot;,&quot;articleId&quot;:12675923,&quot;socialHeadline&quot;:&quot;Why you should skip the pumpkin patch this year&quot;,&quot;authors&quot;:[&quot;Fleur Britten&quot;],&quot;firstPubDate&quot;:&quot;2023-10-29T13:22:12+0000&quot;,&quot;shortURL&quot;:&quot;https://mol.im/a/12675923&quot;,&quot;pageTitle&quot;:&quot;Posed pumpkin patch pictures are a celebrity must-have for Halloween, but experts claim celebrities like Kylie Jenner and Reese Witherspoon are encouraging food waste&quot;,&quot;sponsoredArticle&quot;:null,&quot;largePreviewText&quot;:&quot;Celebrities capitalise on the pumpkin patch with photo dumps of pumpkin-filled days out from over the years.

Experts have warned that ticks bearing CCHF have been spreading north from their native habitats thanks to rising temperatures caused by climate change. Now French health authorities announced they have found the live virus for the first time in tests conducted on the nation&#x27;s border with Spain. They found CCHF in live ticks collected from cattle in the Pyrénées Orientales region. CCHF is a haemorrhagic fever, the same class of disease as Ebola, and shares many of the same symptoms, including bleeding from nose, eyes and skin. The World Health Organization declared CCHF one of its nine priority diseases this year due to its potential to spark another pandemic in the future. And British experts warned MPs this year it was highly probable that CCHF would reach the UK on ticks arriving on animals.&quot;,&quot;previewText&quot;:&quot;French health authorities have confirmed they have ticks carrying Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, a virus that kills up to 40 per cent of people it infects, in the country for the first time.&quot;,&quot;channel&quot;:&quot;health&quot;,&quot;showAsLiveDate&quot;:null,&quot;imageLargeDouble&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/26/17/77040847-0-image-a-2_1698336934575.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageLargePreview&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/26/17/77040847-0-image-m-1_1698336930119.jpg&quot;,&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/26/17/77040847-0-image-m-1_1698336930119.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE_PREVIEW_LARGE&quot;},{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/26/16/77039597-0-image-m-33_1698335223535.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE_PREVIEW_THUMB&quot;},{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/26/17/77040847-0-image-a-2_1698336934575.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE LARGE DOUBLE&quot;}],&quot;fbShareCount&quot;:286,&quot;piShareCount&quot;:0,&quot;commentsCount&quot;:963},{&quot;mobileGalleryCount&quot;:14,&quot;headline&quot;:&quot;How Britain&#x27;s fallen out of love with red meat (as well as tea, potatoes, bread and milk!): Fascinating charts show how diets have drastically changed since the 70s - and we now eat up to 80% LESS beef, pork and lamb&quot;,&quot;largeHeadline&quot;:&quot;How Britain&#x27;s fallen out of love with red meat (as well as tea, potatoes, bread and milk!): Fascinating charts show how diets have drastically changed since the 70s - and we now eat up to 80% LESS beef, pork and lamb&quot;,&quot;videoCount&quot;:0,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;GB&quot;,&quot;articleURL&quot;:&quot;/health/article-12670203/Britains-red-meat-tea-potatoes-bread-milk-charts-diets-drastically-changed-70s.html&quot;,&quot;modifiedDate&quot;:&quot;2023-10-27T15:27:24+0100&quot;,&quot;articleId&quot;:12670203,&quot;socialHeadline&quot;:&quot;Fascinating charts show how Britain&#x27;s fallen out of love with meat:&quot;,&quot;authors&quot;:[&quot;John Ely Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline&quot;,&quot;Emily Stearn, Health Reporter For Mailonline&quot;],&quot;firstPubDate&quot;:&quot;2023-10-26T15:13:00+0100&quot;,&quot;shortURL&quot;:&quot;https://mol.im/a/12670203&quot;,&quot;pageTitle&quot;:&quot;How Britain&#x27;s fallen out of love with red meat (as well as tea, potatoes, bread and milk!): Fascinating charts show how diets have drastically changed since the 70s - and we now eat up to 80% LESS beef, pork and lamb&quot;,&quot;sponsoredArticle&quot;:null,&quot;largePreviewText&quot;:&quot;EXCLUSIVE: Red meat, potatoes and bread are off the menu in modern Britian having been replaced by chicken, fish and fruit as data shows how the nation&#x27;s dietary preferences have changed since the 70s. Red meat consumption, for example, has plunged by up to 81 per cent since the 70s amid health fears, the steady rise of veganism and growing concerns about climate change. On average, people now have just 854g (1.88lbs) each week - the equivalent of a steak, three rashers of bacon, three lamb chops, two sausages and a chicken breast. For comparison, the figure stood at 1,023g, or 2.25lbs, in 1974, when records began. Yet, sales of poultry and fish have doubled in a sign that health-conscious Brits are seeking leaner proteins. Other fascinating Government figures show how the humble spud has fallen out of favour, with Brits eating half as much as they did 40 years ago.&quot;,&quot;previewText&quot;:&quot;EXCL: Red meat, potatoes and bread are off the menu in modern Britian, replaced by chicken, fish and fruit as data shows how the nation&#x27;s dietary preferences have changed since the 70s.&quot;,&quot;channel&quot;:&quot;health&quot;,&quot;showAsLiveDate&quot;:null,&quot;imageLargeDouble&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/27/09/77071143-0-image-a-22_1698394829689.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageLargePreview&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/27/09/77071143-0-image-m-21_1698394822649.jpg&quot;,&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/27/09/77071143-0-image-m-21_1698394822649.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE_PREVIEW_LARGE&quot;},{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/27/09/77071143-0-image-a-22_1698394829689.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE LARGE DOUBLE&quot;},{&quot;altTag&quot;:null,&quot;hostUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/26/15/76995659-0-image-a-10_1698328892869.jpg&quot;,&quot;imageType&quot;:&quot;ARTICLE_PREVIEW_THUMB&quot;}],&quot;fbShareCount&quot;:107,&quot;piShareCount&quot;:0,&quot;commentsCount&quot;:1779},{&quot;mobileGalleryCount&quot;:25,&quot;headline&quot;:&quot;Shock images show house perilously close to toppling over cliff as residents of Norfolk village say they have been &#x27;abandoned&#x27; by the Government&quot;,&quot;largeHeadline&quot;:&quot;Shock images show house perilously close to toppling over cliff as residents of Norfolk village say they have been &#x27;abandoned&#x27; by the Government&quot;,&quot;videoCount&quot;:3,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;GB&quot;,&quot;articleURL&quot;:&quot;/news/article-12675271/Norfolk-coastal-village-fear-homes-toppling-cliff.html&quot;,&quot;modifiedDate&quot;:&quot;2023-10-26T14:05:04+0100&quot;,&quot;articleId&quot;:12675271,&quot;socialHeadline&quot;:&quot;House close to toppling over cliff as residents &#x27;abandoned&#x27;&quot;,&quot;authors&quot;:[&quot;Jon Brady&quot;],&quot;firstPubDate&quot;:&quot;2023-10-26T12:19:17+0100&quot;,&quot;shortURL&quot;:&quot;https://mol.im/a/12675271&quot;,&quot;pageTitle&quot;:&quot;Shock images show house perilously close to toppling over cliff as residents of Norfolk village say they have been &#x27;abandoned&#x27; by the Government&quot;,&quot;sponsoredArticle&quot;:null,&quot;largePreviewText&quot;:&quot;Hemsby, around 15 miles east of Norwich and seven miles north of Great Yarmouth, is facing an uncertain future, with nearly 100 homes at risk of falling into the sea as the coastline erodes.
